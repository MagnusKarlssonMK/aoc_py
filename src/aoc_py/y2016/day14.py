"""
2016 day 14 - One-Time Pad

Generate md5 hashes one-by-one, and for each
- check if it has 5 repeated characters, and if so, validate any pending previously found index with 3 repetitions of
that same character
- then check if it has 3 repeated characters, and if so, add its index to a dict of pending keys for validation. Only
add it to the first found character, in case there's more than one triple.

Use a hasher with a cache for at least some chance of reducing time for the ridiculous number of hashings required for
Part 2. It's still really quite slow though, Part 2 takes around a minute to complete.
