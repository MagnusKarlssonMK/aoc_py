2016 day 19 - An Elephant Named Joseph

Part 1: Straight up the Josephus problem. By using binary representation, the answer can be found by shifting the most
significant 1 to the end.

Part 2: Modified variant of the Josephus problem. It can be solved in a similar manner by converting to base-3 number
and then doing similar modifications, but it gets quite a bit more complicated. Instead, find the largest power of 3
that is still smaller than the target, and then the answer can be found based on that. In short, the pattern resets
with 1 as winner on every 'new' / added digit in the base-3 representation (4, 10, 28...); in the first half in-between
those numbers, the winning number is incremented by 1, while in the second half the winning number is incremented by 2.
