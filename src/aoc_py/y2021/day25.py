2021 day 25 - Sea Cucumber

Yet another variant of game-of-life. Storing the cucumbers in separate dictionaries per movement direction, so we can
first move the east-moving ones, and then process the south-moving cucumbers based on that intermittent result. Also
stores in dictionaries per x/y coordinate rather than dumping it all in giant sets of x/y coordinates, which makes it a
bit more complicated but seems to speed up the execution quite a bit.
